# Analysis-for-Kickstarter
Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com) has established itself as the leading platform for funding creative ventures. Aspiring entrepreneurs in the arts can initiate fundraising campaigns on Kickstarter to support their projects. Some projects have been hugely successful, whereas many others have fallen well short of their fundraising objectives. The attached data file contains sample data on over 4000 Kickstarter fundraising campaigns. Each row contains a summary of each campaign, including the goal and amount pledged, the state of the project in securing funding (e.g., successful, failed), the category of the project (i.e., type of art), and whether the project was featured via a staff pick or spotlight (i.e., on the Kickstarter home page).
