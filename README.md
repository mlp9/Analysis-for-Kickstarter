# Analysis-for-Kickstarter
Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com) has established itself as the leading platform for funding creative ventures. Aspiring entrepreneurs in the arts can initiate fundraising campaigns on Kickstarter to support their projects. Some projects have been hugely successful, whereas many others have fallen well short of their fundraising objectives. The attached data file contains sample data on over 4000 Kickstarter fundraising campaigns. Each row contains a summary of each campaign, including the goal and amount pledged, the state of the project in securing funding (e.g., successful, failed), the category of the project (i.e., type of art), and whether the project was featured via a staff pick or spotlight (i.e., on the Kickstarter home page).

Data Analysis tasks performed: 
1) Displayed descriptive statistics that include:
    a. Total number of projects
    b. Amount pledged (in U.S. dollars): min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation
    c. Percentage of projects that earned total pledges of at least $2,500
    
2) Determined the frequency of each category and the proportion (percentage) of observations
for each category.

3) For each project category, calculated the proportion (percentage) of projects that were successful. Created a bar chart showing a title, the categories and their success percentages, properly labeled and formatted.

4) Determined the total number of projects identified as staff picks and the total number of projects identified as spotlight projects. For each of these two project classifications and the success rate (percentage) of each?

5) Identified which feature (staff pick or spotlight) is associated with a higher percentage of successful projects and inferences we can make from the data to explain why one of the features has a higher percentage of successful projects?
